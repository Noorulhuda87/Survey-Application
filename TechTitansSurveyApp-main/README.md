 This is part of 4 the assignment. I ungrouped the form so I can fit the H2 into the form and it's not outside the form. I centered, formatted, and aligned the texts, lines, headers, and buttons so it's a much cleaner look. I also incorporated the new design into the this. I made it into one document. I connected the lines to it so it flows from the very beginning of the mainpage fold to the viewing all the responses from a survey. The color of the surveys are black now to match.
